        <strong>Important Printing Note</strong><br><br>
        This is designed to print 12 cards per A4 paper set to <em>landscape</em> (it will take as many words as you have but 12 per sheet).<br><br>
        Make sure in the print settings the scale is set to 100 and the margins are set to 'none'. The cards should completely cover the page.<br><br>
        Tested with Firefox and Chrome Nov 2021 - other browsers may or may not work.
